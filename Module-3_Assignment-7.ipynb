    "\n",
    "1. You have disparate data formats and sources\n",
    "Your business is collecting data through a variety of applications, such as your accounting and billing software, lead generation tool, email marketing app, CRM, customer service application, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each one of these tools is accessed and maintained by different teams, and they each have their own processes for inputting and updating data. They might even be adding data into the system that already exists in other applications, or in different formats. For example, one team can be entering phone numbers into one application as (00) 555-5555, and another team is entering them in another application as +00 555 5555.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Your data isn't available where it needs to be\n",
    "This results in your team wasting a lot of time and not having access to information that could make all the difference in the performance of their work -- which leads us to the second problem…\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an issue that stems from the existence of data silos. Data silos are groups of data accessible by one department but isolated from the rest of the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there's no coherence as to how, who, and where to enter and update data, you inevitably end up with information silos across your organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that your marketing team is working on a new, highly personalized email campaign to your existing customers. As they're having discussions about how to collect customer data to create a more targeted campaign, your customer support team has been gathering exactly that kind of data -- and marketing knows nothing about it. The data sits inside your customer support software, while marketing is racking their brains trying to think of ways to get that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You have low-quality or outdated data\n",
    "When you have no company-wide standards for data entry and maintenance - and when a lot of it still needs to be done manually -- you inevitably end up with inaccurate, outdated, and/or duplicate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different departments might be inputting the same data into different systems, resulting in duplicates. Or, if your team needs to manually update data every so often, this can lead to mistakes in data entry or to huge amounts of data not being updated at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can also happen if you go long periods of time without organizing your databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, your data is inconsistent and untrustworthy -- and if you can't trust your data, you can't trust the analysis you get from it.\n",

    "4. You're using the wrong integration software for your needs\n",
    "Even if you're already using integration solutions to connect your software ecosystem, you can fall into the trap of using the wrong type of software for what you need -- or you might even have the right software, but you're using it the wrong way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might be using a trigger-based integration to have the databases of two apps aligned. However, this solution doesn't sync historical data (data that was entered into your tools before the integration was set up) and it only pushes data from one platform into another. If what you want is for these databases to be synchronized, you'll need a two-way integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You have too much data\n",
    "There is such a thing as too much data. If your company is collecting data indiscriminately, you end up with a lot of information you don't need, and it could be burying the valuable information beneath it. It's just like object hoarding: if your drawers are full of things you don't need, it makes it a whole lot harder to find the things you do need in the mess, and it takes you a lot more time to find it, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is amplified if you're collecting data from multiple channels without a proper data management system in place. With the sheer amounts of data being created daily, it becomes a big challenge to manage, analyze, and extract value from your data when you can't find the signal in the noise.\n"

    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that over-sampling takes observed rare samples and applies bootstrapping to generate new random data based on a distribution function. If cross-validation is applied after over-sampling, basically what we are doing is overfitting our model to a specific artificial bootstrapping result. That is why cross-validation should always be done before over-sampling the data, just as how feature selection should be implemented. Only by resampling the data repeatedly, randomness can be introduced into the dataset to make sure that there won’t be an overfitting problem.\n"

The problem, he says, is in the people. “There’s no such thing as an AI model that is free of security problems because people decide how to train them, people decide what data to include, people decide what they want to predict and forecast, and people decide how much of that information to expose.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Another security risk specific to AI and ML systems is data poisoning, where an attacker feeds information into a system to force it to make inaccurate predictions. For example, attackers may trick systems into thinking that malicious software is safe by feeding it examples of legitimate software that has indicators similar to malware.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a high concern to most organizations, says Raff. “Right now, I’m not aware of any AI systems actually being attacked in real life,” he says. “It’s a real threat down the line, but right now the classic tools that attackers use to evade antivirus are still effective, so they don’t need to get fancier.”"

    "1. Identify the conflict\n",
    "Stay attentive to every member of a team and observe any potential conflicts before they become more serious. Try to ensure that team members feel comfortable discussing issues and can share problems with each other. Strive to monitor team performance and ask questions to determine how a project is progressing. If you notice a conflict developing on your team, gather as much information as you can. Identify the type of conflict you encounter and consider your next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Communicate\n",
    "Communication is one of the most important aspects of conflict resolution. When you identify a conflict, listen carefully to everyone involved. Ask detailed questions to learn all the facts. You can demonstrate empathy and show each team member that you value their input and want to find a solution that works for them. Try to discuss possible solutions and share your feelings in a tactful and considerate manner. Consider using communication skills to strengthen team relationships and prevent conflicts before they arise.\n",

    "When a conflict arises, it can be tempting to avoid it or move forward without addressing it. This can lead to bigger problems in the future and might cause some team members to lose trust in the shared vision of the team. Try to let each team member know that you understand their issues and want to help resolve them. Strive to address problems when they arise and develop open lines of communication between team leaders and team members. Try to be solution-oriented and think of creative ways to resolve conflicts and avoid them in the future.\n",

    "Many companies have detailed procedures to follow when certain conflicts occur. Many human resource departments develop codes of conduct for employees to follow in the workplace. Some workplace teams have their own rules and guidelines for employee behaviour. Strive to learn the policies in your workplace and follow them as best you can. Some conflicts might require you to make a report to upper management or human resources. Companies develop these procedures through experience and careful consultation so they can be a helpful guide for conflict resolution."

    "\n",
    "1. Efficient Data Storage:\n",
    "- Evaluate the data storage requirements and optimize storage usage by compressing data, removing redundant or unused data, and implementing data retention policies.\n",
    "- Consider using cost-effective storage options such as object storage services or data lakes instead of more expensive storage solutions.\n",

    "- Design and refactor applications to make use of serverless architecture where possible, benefiting from automatic scaling and reduced infrastructure management costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Optimize Data Transfer Costs:\n",
    "- Minimize data transfer costs between different components of the machine learning pipeline by strategically placing resources closer to the data source or utilizing data caching techniques.\n",
    "- Explore data compression techniques to reduce the size of data transferred, thus reducing network bandwidth requirements and associated costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Cost-Effective Model Training:\n",
