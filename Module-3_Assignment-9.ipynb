    "    Transfer learning is a machine learning (ML) method that reuses a trained model designed for a particular task to accomplish a different yet related task. The knowledge acquired from task one is thereby transferred to the second model that focuses on the new task.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The term ‘transfer learning’ is related to human psychology. For example, consider an individual who is an expert guitarist. It is quite easy for him to learn to play other stringed instruments, such as a sitar or mandolin, compared to someone with no experience playing any musical instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Similarly, consider a simple classifier trained to predict whether an image contains a hand purse. In this case, you can use the knowledge gained by that model to recognize other objects, such as wallets, sunglasses, etc., in subsequent tasks.\n",

The aim of the pretext task (also known as a supervised task) is to guide the model to learn intermediate representations of data. It is useful in understanding the underlying structural meaning that is beneficial for the practical downstream tasks. \n",
    "    Generative models can be considered self-supervised models but with different objectives. For e.g. in GANs, they are used to generate realistic images for the discriminator whereas the aim of self-supervised training is to identify good features that can be used for a variety of tasks and not just to fool the discriminator.\n",

We are also interested in understanding the threats of adversarial samples from the cybersecurity perspective. However, the present taxonomies of adversarial attacks are often decided according to individual strategies, while neglecting the relationships between different attacks from a global view. Inspired by APTs, we propose an analysis framework for adversarial attacks that could help to establish a standard in understanding the security problems of deep learning systems.

However, a more complex model is more prone to overfitting and may not generalize well to unseen data. Regularization techniques, by penalizing complex models, strike a balance between model complexity and generalization performance.

I’ve been referring to the metric we care about as the “generalization gap.” This is typically the measure of generalization authors use in papers but for simplicity in our study we only care about the test accuracy being as high as possible. As we will see, both the training and testing accuracy will depend on batch size so it’s more meaningful to talk about test accuracy rather than generalization gap. More specifically, we want the test accuracy after some large number of epochs of training or “asymptotic test accuracy” to be high. How many epochs is a “large number of epochs”? Ideally this is defined as the number of epochs of training required such that any further training provides little to no boost in test accuracy. In practice this is difficult to determine and we will have to make our best guess at how many epochs is appropriate to reach asymptotic behavior.
